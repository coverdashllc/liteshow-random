|----------|-------|-------------|
| `PUBLIC_API_URL` | Your Liteshow API URL | Contact Liteshow support for your API URL |

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:4321

**Note:** When running locally, the site fetches content from your Liteshow project's API. Make sure your content is published in the Liteshow dashboard.

## How It Works

This Astro site fetches your published content from the Liteshow API at build time. The workflow is simple:

1. **Create/edit content** in Liteshow dashboard
2. **Publish** your pages when ready
3. **Deploy** from the Deployment tab (GitHub Pages) or push to your main branch
4. **Live!** Your site is rebuilt with the latest content

Content is fetched securely from your project's database via the Liteshow API.
